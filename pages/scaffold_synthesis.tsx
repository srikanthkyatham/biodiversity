                <div className="faqsection">
                    <h4>What are the impurities in different pharmaceutical preparations? </h4>
                    <p>
                    Impurities are unwanted chemical substances that are completely different from the chemical composition of different drug substances. They may differ in structure, chemistry and enantiomer.

                </div>

                <div className="faqsection">
                    <h4>What are the different sources of impurities? </h4>
                    <p>
                    The different sources of impurities include degradation, manufacturing or synthetic procedures, container, storage conditions, contamination and excipients.

                <div className="faqsection">
                    <h4>What is the significance of testing impurities? </h4>            
                    <p>
                    If impurities are present beyond acceptance limits, they may affect the safety, quality, efficacy and identity of drug products or substances. They may also cause product degradation and lead to serious problems regarding product stability. Therefore, proper quantitative and qualitative impurity testing is crucial.

                <div className="faqsection">
                    <h4>What are reference standards?  </h4>
                    <p>
                    Reference standards are characterized samples of excipients, drug substances, degradation products, reportable impurities and compendial reagents. Scientists use reference standards to regulate qualitative and quantitative data, calibrators and performance standards.
