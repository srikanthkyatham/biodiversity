                <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 text-left text-black block px-10 py-2 rounded-md text-1xl font-normal">
                    <li>Having an unbiased view of clientâ€™s project, considering all major and minor synthesis technologies and not only the most sophisticated ones.</li>
                    <li>Giving clients the flexibility and ease of asking the right questions. We know that majority of the projects fail as customers are not familiar with the different aspects of chemical synthesis. Therefore, we make it easier for them to know the ins and outs of all synthesis options they can avail from us, including their individual benefits and drawbacks.</li>
                    <li>Helping customers decide on the right technology for process optimization considering the large scale availability of new synthesis technologies; safety regulations; starting materials and IP restrictions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Also, if we are unable to handle certain special issues, we make use of our integrated connections with different specialized technology service providers. Chemical and contract syntheses are an important part of our regular work to develop sustainable and highly innovative approaches to molecules that exhibit special properties.

                    <h4>What is API process development? </h4>
                    <p>
                    API process development offers the basis for process validation, improvement and constant process optimization. Development scientists take up API or advanced process development to devise brand new production procedures or to refine the existing ones.

                </div>

                <div className="faqsection">
                    <h4>What are the different procedures considerations for API development? </h4>            
                    <p>
                    Procedure considerations for API or drug development include, selecting the solvent; ensuring process safety; addressing process scale-up problems and analysing critical process parameters.
